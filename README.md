# Netlify Serverless Function Tweeter

Twitter's cool, but it also sucks. With this simple [Netlify function](https://functions.netlify.com/), I can tweet using `someurl.com/tweet?t=Hello World` right from any browser. 

I wanted to do this mostly so that I can use twitter as a link-dump, producing a high volume of low-effort content that could be personally useful to look back on. Also, so I don't have to open the wretched app.

Fork this, build it on Netlify, and set your Twitter API keys in Netlify's Environment Variable settings. Boom. Tweet without going on Twitter easily from the url bar.
